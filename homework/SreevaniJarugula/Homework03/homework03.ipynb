    "## Problem 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week you showed that Bayesian and Frequentist approaches are often equivalent for simple problems (after all you implicitly had a prior in the form of a grid). \n",
    "\n",
    "But it is also true that they can diverge greatly. In practice, this divergence makes itself most clear in two different situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The handling of \"nuisance parameters\"\n",
    "2. The subtle (and often overlooked) difference between frequentist confidence intervals and Bayesian credible intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we focus on the first point: the difference between frequentist and Bayesian treatment of nuisance parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Nuisance Parameter?\n",
    "\n",
    "***A nuisance parameter is any quantity whose value is not relevant to the goal of an analysis, but is nevertheless required to determine some quantity of interest***.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, last week, in problem 3, we estimated both the mean $C$ and shape $\\sigma_\\text{source}$ for some spherical cow galaxy. Now the shape might be important, but in homework 1, you only needed the brightness of the sources where you plotted up $r$ vs $g-i$ for galaxies (you needed the shape to separate stars from galaxies in the form of MEAN_OBJECT_TYPE, but that's it).\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as you were concerned in homework 1, the shape was a **nuisance** parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Classic Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with an example of nuisance parameters that, in one form or another, dates all the way back to the posthumous [1763 paper](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/history/essay.pdf) written by Thomas Bayes himself. The particular version of this problem we'll study is borrowed from [Eddy 2004](ftp://selab.janelia.org/pub/publications/Eddy-ATG3/Eddy-ATG3-reprint.pdf)."

    "The setting is a rather contrived game in which Alice and Bob bet on the outcome of a process they can't directly observe:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Alice and Bob enter a room. Behind a curtain there is a billiard table, which they cannot see, but their friend Carol can. Carol rolls a ball down the table, and marks where it lands. Once this mark is in place, Carol begins rolling new balls down the table. If the ball lands to the left of the mark, Alice gets a point; if it lands to the right of the mark, Bob gets a point.  We can assume for the sake of example that Carol's rolls are unbiased: that is, the balls have an equal chance of ending up anywhere on the table.  **The first person to reach six points wins the game.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here ***the location of the mark (determined by the first roll) can be considered a nuisance parameter***.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is unknown, and not of immediate interest, but it clearly must be accounted for when predicting the outcome of subsequent rolls. If the first roll settles far to the right, then subsequent rolls will favor Alice. If it settles far to the left, Bob will be favored instead."

    "\n",
