    "###  Fitting a Line using a Maximum Likelihood Estimator\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, you implcitly fitted straight lines with methods of moments estimators (i.e. sample mean and variance) and L-estimators (median and IQR). Generally though, we want some kind of uncertainty estimate for our models, and therefore M-estimators and maximum likelihood estimators in particular are useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume the scatter in our measurements (the residuals) is generated by a gaussian process. I.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$ y_i = a x_i + b + r_i $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r_i$ is drawn from $N(0, \\sigma)$. Here, $\\sigma$ is the error the measurement induces.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use an M-estimator/MLE, you have to specify the likelihood function. First, the probability $p(y_i|x_i, M(a, b), \\sigma)$ that a particular point $y_i$ would be measured is just the normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$ p(y_i|x_i, M(a, b), \\sigma) = N(y_i - M(x)|\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}} \\exp \\left( - \\frac{(y_i - M(x_i))^2}{2 \\sigma^2} \\right) $.\n",

    "Given what we discussed in class, we can write down the $\\ln L$\n",
    "\n",
    ">$ \\ln L(a, b) = constant - \\frac{1}{2 \\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - M(x_i))^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the expression that we now minimize with respect to $a$ and $b$ to find ML estimators for those parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And as we discussed in class, this is equivalent to minimizing the sum of the squares or a _least-squares method_.\n",

    "## MLE with outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply the MLE to data with uncertainties where these uncertainties include outliers. \n",
    "I've defined a dataset below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- write a function that computes the squared loss, and incorporates the uncertainties on the measurements, $dy$\n",
    "- Fit a line to the full sample by evaluating this likelihood on a grid of a, b\n",
    "- Use sigma-clipping or an L-estimator for outlier rejection and fit a line to the data with outliers rejected\n",
    "- Make a QQ plot of the residuals\n",
    "- Define a new likelihood function that implements the Huber loss, also incorporating the measurement uncertainties $dy$\n",
    "- Fit a new line to all of the data (no outlier rejection) with the new Huber likelihod, except now use scipy.optimize.fmin instead of a grid search.\n",
